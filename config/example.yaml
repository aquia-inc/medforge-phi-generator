# MedForge Configuration Example
# Use this file with: medforge generate --config config/example.yaml

# Total number of documents to generate
count: 200

# Specific PHI positive/negative counts (if not set, uses 80/20 split from count)
phi_positive: 160
phi_negative: 40

# Comma-separated list of formats to generate
# Valid options: pdf, docx, xlsx, eml, pptx
formats: "pdf,docx,xlsx,eml,pptx"

# Output directory for generated documents
output: "output/medforge"

# Percentage of documents to enhance with LLM (0.0 to 1.0)
# Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
llm_percentage: 0.2

# Random seed for reproducibility (optional)
# Set to a specific number for consistent results across runs
seed: 42

# Number of parallel workers for generation
# 1 = sequential (slower but uses less memory)
# >1 = parallel (faster but uses more memory)
parallel_workers: 4
